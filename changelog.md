# Week 6

## Monday, 8/April [Henry]
- This file is missing WHO has done WHAT, and on WHICH DAYS. [Henry]
- Both of you: function comments. I made a big fuss about this on the unit site last week. [Henry]
- Classes need to start with a capital letter [Henry]
- You both need a minimum 2 days per week to pass under normal circumstances. 
- I need to get serious with you here: To catch up, you'll need to do much more. If you're not intending to pass, look into withdrawing from the unit and trying again next year.
